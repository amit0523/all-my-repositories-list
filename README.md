Since Github shows only 6 repositories on my profile page/dashboard, I have
created this repository that contains all the other repositories that I have
on Github.

The list is below:

* https://github.com/amit0523/generic-doubly-linked-list-library
* https://github.com/amit0523/get-line-from-file
* https://github.com/amit0523/check-line-length-80-characters
* https://github.com/amit0523/text-menu-for-user
* https://github.com/amit0523/str-split
* https://github.com/amit0523/substr
* https://github.com/amit0523/str-join
